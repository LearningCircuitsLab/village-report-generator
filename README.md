The reports are made using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), a publishing system that allows you to create dynamic documents, presentations, and websites.
You will need to install Quarto on your system (or server) to generate the reports.

Crontab is used to schedule the report generation.

Reports are running now under the user `training_village` on the server `minibaps`.

Whatever user runs the report, it needs writing access to this repository.
